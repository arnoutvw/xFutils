# DISCONTINUED
This Project is discontinued. The architecture and structure is less than optimal and I sadly lack the time and interest to fix this. If somebody would like to create something similar it would be highly recommended starting from scratch because this is mostly hacked together. 

This Repository will be archived as a testament of my former programming skills. Please don't take this as an example of my code!

# xFutils
The goal of this Project is to create a system tray for windows. The system tray will support plugins and links that can be started through the menu.

Planed Plugins:
- Extended Clipboard Plugin (A way to recall the last few clipboard contents)
- Timer Plugin (With a stopwatch, a countdown timer and a usual timer)
- PC use statistic Plugin (Count's the time you actually spend on the PC, what applications you use, keyboard and mouse interactions etc.)

## WARNING
Some pieces of code may contain commands and explanations, we are currently dealing with this problem!!!
